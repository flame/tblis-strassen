Strassen's Algorithm for Tensor Contraction

- Compile the source code:
  Replace $INSTALL_PATH with the installation path the user wants to specify.
  $ tar -zxvf tblis-strassen.tar.gz
  $ cd tblis-strassen
  $ autoreconf -i
  $ ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_PATH \
      --disable-shared --enable-config=sandybridge
  $ make && make install

- Parameters for the test routine:
  The executable ``./test_strassen'' is generated after the compilation in the ``bin'' folder. Here is the detailed specification for the arguments.
  ^Usage: ./test_strassen -m $NIm -n $NJn -k $NPk -niter $niter -level $L -impl $IMPL -seed $seed
  $NIm: NIm; $NJn: NJn; $NPk: NPk; $niter: number of iterations;
  $L: levels of Strassen ( L=0 will invoke regular tblis TC routine);
  $IMPL: implementations [ 1: ABC Strassen, 2: AB Strassen, 3: Naive Strassen ];
  $seed: random seeds.

  ^Usage: ./test_strassen -niter $niter -level $L -impl $IMPL -seed $seed -file $filename
  $niter: number of iterations;
  $L: levels of Strassen ( L=0 will invoke regular tblis TC routine);
  $IMPL: implementations [ 1: ABC Strassen, 2: AB Strassen, 3: Naive Strassen ];
  $filename: the benchmark file.
  $seed: random seeds.

- Options for random seed $seed:
  - if $seed == -1: default seeding.
  - if $seed is equal to any number other than -1, $seed will be used as the random seed for the synthetic tensor sizes, shapes, and permutations.
  - if not specified, using time as the random seed.

- Set up environment variables:
  Replace $core_num with the number of cores the user wants to run.
  $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$core_num
  $ export KMP_AFFINITY=compact
  Note: if hyper-threading is enabled, the following alternative must be used:
  $ export KMP_AFFINITY=compact,1

- Single node experiment (synthetic tensor contractions): Replace $NIm with NIm, $NJn with NJn, $NPk with NPk, $niter with the iterations the user wants to run, $L with number of levels of Strassen to employ (L = 0 will invoke regular tblis TC routine), and $IMPL with the implementations the user wants to test. $IMPL has the following options, [ 1: ABC Strassen, 2: AB Strassen, 3: Naive Strassen ].
  $ cd bin
  $ ./test_strassen -m $NIm -n $NJn -k $NPk -niter $niter -level $L -impl $IMPL
  We have prepared the testing scripts in bin folder so the user can run it directly to reproduce the experiments in this paper (e.g. square_run_1core.sh ).

- Single node experiment (real-world benchmark):
  $ cd bin
  $ ./test_strassen -file $benchmark_filename
  We have prepared the benchmark from [36] as tcb.txt and the test scripts (e.g. tcb_run_1core.sh) to make it easier for the user to reproduce the result presented in this paper.

- Single node experiment (shape-dependence experiment):
  $ cd bin
  $ ./test_strassen -file $shape_filename
  We have prepared the test cases we use as shape.txt and the test scripts (e.g. shape_run_1core.sh) to make it easier for the user to reproduce the result presented in this paper.

- Distributed memory experiment:
  Replace $P with the edge length of the P Ã— P mesh the user wants to test on.
  Note: replace $INSTALL_PATH variable in Makefile with the TBLIS installation path specified in compilation step.
  $ cd dist
  $ make
  $ sbatch ./submit_${P}x${P}.sh

- User specified benchmark format:
  index bundle of C,A,B & dimension length.
  e.g. C(a,b,c) += A(d,c,a) * B(d,b):
  abc dca db & a:4;b:8;c:2;d:8;
  
  More example can be found in each line in bin/tcb.txt and bin/shape.txt
