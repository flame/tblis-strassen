# --- Configuration variable definitions ---------------------------------------
#
# Environment-related variables:
#   REVISION            - The code's revision number.
#   PWD                 - The path to current working directory.
#   ARCH_STR            - A string to identify the requested build architecture.
#   BUILD_STR           - A string to identify the requested build type.
#   CCOMPILER_STR       - A string to identify the requested C compiler.
#
# Target-related variables:
#   FLAMEC_OBJS         - List of paths to flamec object files.
#   LAPACK2FLAMEC_OBJS  - List of paths to lapack2flamec object files.
#
# Note: these variables are not present in the .in template file. Instead, they
# are appended to the contents of the .in file by a build script and output to
# a separate file (by the same name, without the .in extension).
